The primary objective of this project was to design, construct, and program an embedded system utilizing an ARM microcontroller and PCB technology. The aim for each group of four students was to engineer a remote-controlled vehicle, referred to as the Wacky Racer, and its corresponding controller, known as the Wacky Hat. The Wacky Hat employed head motions to control the remote vehicle. The culmination of our project was marked by an exciting race event, during which our team emerged victorious in one of the rounds.

I programmed the racer, code for which can be found in src->apps->racer. This directory contains many supporting drivers developed by the Computer Engineering Department at the University of Canterbury.
